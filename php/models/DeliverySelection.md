| Field | Presence | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `buyer_location` | Optional | object and Alternative shapes (see declared variants) | Buyer location snapshot used to evaluate pickup proximity. Returned with an API key or dashboard credential. The normalized buyer address or coordinate used for this quote. `buyer_location`: [declared alternatives](../models/EffectiveDeliverySelectionResponse.md#effectivedeliveryselectionresponsedatadelivery_selection-variant-1buyer_location). |
| `calculation_expires_at` | Optional | string | Deadline after which calculated pricing evidence is no longer valid. Always present with an API key or dashboard credential. Format: `date-time`. |
| `checkout_session_id` | Optional | string | Checkout session that owns the selection. Always present with an API key or dashboard credential. |
| `choices` | Required | Array of [DeliverySelectionChoiceResource](../models/DeliverySelectionChoiceResource.md#deliveryselectionchoiceresource) | One chosen option for each required choice group. `choices[]`: [field definitions](../models/EffectiveDeliverySelectionResponse.md#effectivedeliveryselectionresponsedatadelivery_selection-variant-1choices). |
| `created_at` | Optional | string | Time the selection was created. Always present with an API key or dashboard credential. Format: `date-time`. |
| `delivery_quote_id` | Required | string | Quote from which this selection was made. |

Omitted for a checkout session credential that doesn't act for the customer the buyer verified. A postal address. Every address has country. Addresses Flint checked as complete (customer and saved addresses, merchant, location, invoice, order delivery destination, tax identity, fulfillment recipient and pickup addresses) always have line1 and city, and US ones always have state and postal_code. Delivery quote destinations, buyer locations and postal-code tax locations hold only what was provided, such as postal_code and country. `destination_address`: [field definitions](../models/EffectiveDeliverySelectionResponse.md#effectivedeliveryselectionresponsedatadelivery_selection-variant-1destination_address). |

Payment fails with ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED, reason configuration_required, and the delivery_selection reference until a new delivery selection includes them. Empty when nothing is missing, and always empty unless status is selected. `input_requirements[]`: [field definitions](../models/CheckoutSessionResponse.md#checkoutsessionresponsedatadeliverychoice_groupscandidate_outcomesinput_requirements). |
