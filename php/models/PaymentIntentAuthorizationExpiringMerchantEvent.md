### PaymentIntentAuthorizationExpiringMerchantEvent.data fields 1.object

The affected public resource without expansions, client authority fields, or fields computed for an individual caller. The resource snapshot, without expansions. Webhooks omit these fields: `processing_fee_money`, `add_on_fees`, `merchant_net_money`.

| Field | Presence | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `add_on_fees` | Optional | Array of [PaymentAddOnFee](../models/PaymentAddOnFee.md#paymentaddonfee) | Itemized invoice, subscription, and automatic tax fees collected with this payment. Available to the merchant only. Empty until fees settle or when no add-ons apply. Refunds do not return or revise these fees. Absent until Flint has determined and verified the fee. If Flint can't verify it when you read the payment intent, the field is omitted rather than shown unverified; read the payment intent again later. |
| `amount_money` | Required | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | The amount requested from the buyer, including any tip_money. Capturing doesn't change it: after a partial capture it still shows the requested amount, and captured_money shows what was collected. On a standalone payment intent, PATCH can change it only before the first confirmation attempt. An amount_money or tip_money change that leaves too little for stored splits returns LIMIT_EXCEEDED at the changed field with minimum_money. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |
| `authorization_expires_at` | Optional | string | Effective Flint deadline to capture a manual-capture hold: the earlier of the provider capture deadline and any order resource guarantee. Order guarantees last at most 24 hours from the payment attempt start and may end earlier. Capture is refused at or after this time, even while status is requires_capture. Omitted until a hold is placed. Format: `date-time`. |
| `authorized_at` | Optional | string | When the processor authorized the payment. Absent until then. Format: `date-time`. |
| `authorized_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | The amount the processor authorized. It always equals amount_money and doesn't change once set, even when a capture collects more. On a payment intent canceled with cancellation_reason payment_returned, it equals the authorization Flint released instead. Absent until the payment is authorized, and on payments canceled before authorization. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |
| `cancellation_reason` | Optional | string | Flint-normalized reason the payment intent was canceled. Present only while status is canceled. Unknown processor values are returned as payment_canceled. Values: [9 declared values](#paymentintentauthorizationexpiringmerchanteventdata-fields-1object-cancellation_reason-values). |
| `capturable_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | The part of the authorization you can still capture. Positive only while status is requires_capture, and zero after you capture or cancel or the authorization expires. The authorization lapses at authorization_expires_at, and a capture attempted after that fails even if this is positive. Absent until the payment is authorized. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |
| `capture_method` | Optional | string | When money is collected. Defaults to automatic. Values: `"automatic"`, `"manual"`. |
| `captured_at` | Optional | string | When money was captured. For automatic capture, this is when the payment succeeded. Absent until capture. Format: `date-time`. |
| `captured_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | The amount collected from the buyer, including captured_tip_money. Reconcile revenue and print receipts from this amount, not amount_money. Zero while a hold is open, and positive whenever status is succeeded. After an overcapture it is above authorized_money. Also positive on a payment intent canceled with cancellation_reason payment_returned: Flint captured the money and is returning it through a refund with reason payment_returned. processing_fee_money, merchant_net_money, and refunds are based on it. Absent until the payment is authorized. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |
| `captured_tip_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | The part of captured_money that is a tip: the capture's tip_money when it sent one, otherwise the tip the authorization carried, at most captured_money. tip_money keeps the tip the authorization carried. Refunds return it last. Absent until the payment is captured. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |
| `checkout_session_id` | Optional | string | Flint checkout session ID associated with this payment, when present. |
| `created_at` | Optional | string | RFC3339 timestamp. Format: `date-time`. |
| `customer` | Optional | [ExpandedCustomerSummary](../models/ExpandedCustomerSummary.md#expandedcustomersummary) or null | The linked customer. Returned only with expand=customer. Present only when `expand` includes `customer`; `null` when expanded and there is no related customer. |
| `customer_id` | Optional | string | Customer linked to this payment intent. |
| `customer_presence` | Required | string | Whether the customer was present for the most recent confirmation. absent means Flint charged a saved card without them, as a merchant-initiated payment on its stored credential. Subscription renewals and automatic invoice charges are absent, and other payments are absent only when confirmed or paid with customer_presence absent. A customer who pays any of them with a card they enter makes it present. Each confirmation sets it again. Values: `"present"`, `"absent"`. |
| `dispute_status` | Optional | string | Dispute state of this payment. none means no dispute or inquiry is open or recorded. The inquiry_ values track an issuer inquiry or early warning that isn't a chargeback. Read the dispute with GET /v1/disputes for its deadline and evidence. Values: [10 declared values](#paymentintentauthorizationexpiringmerchanteventdata-fields-1object-dispute_status-values). |
| `external_reference_id` | Optional | string or null | Caller-owned identifier for this resource in an external system. minLength: `1`. maxLength: `255`. |
| `fulfillment_hold` | Optional | [PaymentFulfillmentHold](../models/PaymentFulfillmentHold.md#paymentfulfillmenthold) | Present when a payment provider asked Flint to pause fulfillment for this payment. While its status is active, open fulfillments on the order are on hold with reason payment_review. payment_intent.fulfillment_hold_updated is sent when the hold starts and when it lifts. A hold on fulfillment tied to a payment, with the reason, the action required, and whether the hold is active or released. `fulfillment_hold`: [field definitions](../models/PaymentIntentResponse.md#paymentintentresponsedatafulfillment_hold). |
| `invoice` | Optional | [ExpandedInvoiceSummary](../models/ExpandedInvoiceSummary.md#expandedinvoicesummary) or null | The linked invoice. Returned only with expand=invoice. Present only when `expand` includes `invoice`; `null` when expanded and there is no related invoice. |

| `latest_order_payment_attempt_id` | Optional | string or null | The order payment attempt that most recently used this payment intent. Start times count to the second; of attempts that started in the same second, the one with the highest order_payment_attempt_id is named. `null` when no attempt has used it yet; omitted for payment intents without an order. It changes only when an attempt starts using this payment intent, which advances version. Returned with merchant credentials; omitted with buyer and checkout credentials. |
| `merchant_id` | Optional | string | Merchant that owns this payment intent. |
| `merchant_net_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | Captured amount minus processing_fee_money, every amount in add_on_fees, platform_fee.amount_money, and each split commitment. Live, succeeded and fully_reversed splits commit their whole amount; payment_not_completed and install_revoked cancellations commit nothing. A failed split commits only money already taken back before failure; its remainder returns to the collecting merchant. Refunds do not reduce the commitment. Later merchant assessments and credits are separate balance effects. Absent until Flint has determined and verified the fee. If Flint can't verify it when you read the payment intent, the field is omitted rather than shown unverified; read the payment intent again later. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |
| `metadata` | Required | Map of string | Caller-owned metadata. Keys starting with flint_ are reserved for Flint and aren't returned. Caller-owned key-value data stored on a resource. Keys starting with flint_ are reserved for Flint and are not returned. Writes follow the limits on MetadataInput and MetadataPatchInput; maps written before those limits may not satisfy them. Map values: maxLength: `4096`. `metadata`: [field definitions](../models/PaymentIntentResponse.md#paymentintentresponsedatametadata). |
| `order` | Optional | [ExpandedOrderSummary](../models/ExpandedOrderSummary.md#expandedordersummary) or null | The linked order. Returned only with expand=order. Present only when `expand` includes `order`; `null` when expanded and there is no related order. |
| `order_id` | Optional | string | Order this payment intent belongs to. Create it through the order and confirm it with POST /v1/orders/{order_id}/pay. Capture and cancel use POST /v1/payment-intents/{payment_intent_id}/capture or /cancel for every payment intent. Order-owned intents accept PATCH for metadata and external_reference_id. |
| `overcapture` | Optional | [PaymentIntentOvercapture](../models/PaymentIntentOvercapture.md#paymentintentovercapture) | Whether one capture can collect more than the authorization, and the most it can collect. Present once a payment with request_overcapture true is authorized. Read it to show the limit; capture enforces it. Whether one capture can collect more than the authorization. |
| `payment_flow` | Required | string | How the payment was started. Fixed when the payment intent is created. Values: `"checkout"`, `"payment_link"`, `"invoice"`, `"subscription_initial"`, `"subscription_renewal"`, `"virtual_terminal"`, `"api"`. |

| `platform_fee` | Optional | [PaymentIntentPlatformFee](../models/PaymentIntentPlatformFee.md#paymentintentplatformfee) | The platform fee a partner app charges on this payment, when it created the payment with an install token and a fee. Absent when the payment carries none. Returned only to merchant credentials; omitted for buyer and checkout credentials. The platform fee a partner app charges on this payment. The merchant pays it beside processing_fee_money and add_on_fees, and merchant_net_money subtracts it. `platform_fee`: [field definitions](../models/PaymentIntentResponse.md#paymentintentresponsedataplatform_fee). |
| `processing_fee_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | Flint's all-in processing fee for this payment. It is the complete price Flint charges to process the payment, never a provider cost passed through. The fee is final once the card payment is captured or the ACH payment succeeds; canceled payments and failures before success have none, except a payment intent canceled with cancellation_reason payment_returned, which shows the fee charged at capture on the charge Flint is returning. Flint returns that fee to your balance separately. Invoice, subscription, and automatic tax fees are itemized separately in add_on_fees. Your net for the payment is captured_money minus this fee and the add-on fees. Refunds do not return or revise it. Absent until Flint has determined and verified the fee. If Flint can't verify it when you read the payment intent, the field is omitted rather than shown unverified; read the payment intent again later. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |

Format: `date-time`. |
| `refund_status` | Optional | string | How much of captured_money has been refunded, including value issued as store credit, based on refunded_money. Values: `"none"`, `"partially_refunded"`, `"refunded"`. |
| `refunded_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | Total refunded against captured_money, including value issued as store credit and processor refunds still pending.

| `released_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | The part of the authorization returned to the buyer without being charged: the uncaptured remainder after a partial capture, or the whole authorization after a cancellation or expiry. It was never collected, so it needs no refund and can't be captured later. Zero after a capture at or above the authorization. Absent until the payment is authorized. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. |

Child changes do not send payment_intent.updated. Omitted for buyer and checkout credentials. `splits[]`: [field definitions](../models/PaymentIntentResponse.md#paymentintentresponsedatasplits). |
| `statement_descriptor` | Required | string or null | The text shown on the buyer's card or bank statement for this payment. `null` until the charge is created. `null` when the provider supplies no descriptor. Frozen when the charge is created. |
| `status` | Required | string | Lifecycle status. requires_payment_method covers both a new payment intent and one whose last attempt failed, so read last_payment_error with it. succeeded, canceled, and expired are final.

An action that isn't listed returns 409 ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED. A listed action can still be refused because of something outside the payment intent: an open risk review, an order payment attempt that is using this payment, a closed order, or the merchant's account. An order-owned payment intent never lists confirm; pay it with POST /v1/orders/{order_id}/pay. The list changes only when the payment intent changes. Always empty for buyer credentials. New actions may be added. Items values: `"confirm"`, `"capture"`, `"cancel"`. |
| `tip_money` | Optional | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) or null | Portion of amount_money that is a tip. Uses amount_money's currency and is at most amount_money. |
