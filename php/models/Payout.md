| `balance_source_type` | Required | string | Balance source this payout draws from. Flint chooses the source when balance_source_type is omitted at create. Clients must accept source types added in future releases. Values: `"card"`, `"bank_account"`. |
| `created_at` | Required | string | When the payout was created. Format: `date-time`. |
| `currency` | Required | string | ISO 4217 currency code. minLength: `3`. maxLength: `3`. pattern: `^[A-Z]{3}$`. |
| `description` | Optional | string | Description sent when the payout was created. Absent when there is none. |
| `external_reference_id` | Optional | string | Caller-owned identifier for this resource in an external system. maxLength: `255`. |
| `failure_code` | Optional | string | Flint-normalized payout failure code. Unknown provider values are returned as payout_failed. Values: [16 declared values](IncomingWebhook358012160ab8PayloadInput.md#incomingwebhook358012160ab8payloadinputdataobject-failure_code-values). |
| `failure_message` | Optional | string | Flint-authored payout failure message. This is stable explanatory text, not a raw provider message. |
| `fee_amount_status` | Required | string | Whether the payout fee is estimated or final. not_applicable means no applicable fee status is known, including unmapped fee states. Values: `"estimated"`, `"final"`, `"not_applicable"`. |
| `fee_money` | Required | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) or null | Fee for this payout, never negative. Payouts carry no fee, so this is 0 once your processor records the payout, and null until then. |
| `initiated_by` | Required | string | What started the payout. A payout imported from your processor follows the processor: scheduled when it sent the payout automatically, otherwise manual. Only scheduled payouts list their balance transactions through GET /v1/balance-transactions?payout_id=; other payouts return 409 with reason not_itemized. Unmapped sources are returned as other. Values: `"manual"`, `"scheduled"`, `"platform"`, `"other"`. |
| `merchant_id` | Required | string | Merchant receiving the payout. |
| `metadata` | Optional | Map of string | Caller-owned metadata. Values can't be empty strings. Keys starting with flint_ are reserved for Flint, are not returned, and cannot be written through the public API. Caller-owned key-value data stored on a resource. Keys starting with flint_ are reserved for Flint and are not returned. Writes follow the limits on MetadataInput and MetadataPatchInput; maps written before those limits may not satisfy them.

| `method` | Required | string | Payout method. instant can appear on imported payouts; unmapped methods are returned as other. Values: `"standard"`, `"instant"`, `"other"`. |
| `net_money` | Required | [SignedMoney](../models/SignedMoney.md#signedmoney) or null | Signed effect of this payout on your Flint balance. It is negative because the payout takes money out: a 25000 payout with no fee has net_money -25000. Null until your processor records the payout. |
| `original_payout` | Optional | [ExpandedPayoutSummary](../models/ExpandedPayoutSummary.md#expandedpayoutsummary) or null | The payout this one reverses, inlined when you request expand=original_payout. null when expanded and original_payout_id is absent. |
| `original_payout_id` | Optional | string | On a payout that reverses another payout, the payout it reverses. Present only when Flint has the matching original payout. A payout has at most one of original_payout_id and reversed_by_payout_id. |
| `payout_destination` | Optional | [ExpandedPayoutDestinationSummary](../models/ExpandedPayoutDestinationSummary.md#expandedpayoutdestinationsummary) or null | The payout destination, inlined when you request expand=payout_destination. null when expanded and payout_destination_id is absent. |

| `payout_id` | Required | string | Stable identifier of the payout. |
| `reversal_status` | Required | string | Whether Flint has pulled a paid payout back from your bank: none until the reversal completes, then reversed. A payout_reversal balance transaction returns the money, and status stays paid. Values: `"none"`, `"reversed"`. |
| `reversed_by_payout` | Optional | [ExpandedPayoutSummary](../models/ExpandedPayoutSummary.md#expandedpayoutsummary) or null | The payout reversing this one, inlined when you request expand=reversed_by_payout. null when expanded and reversed_by_payout_id is absent. |
| `reversed_by_payout_id` | Optional | string | The separate payout reversing this one, when Flint has the matching payout. Its presence does not mean the reversal has completed; read reversal_status. A payout has at most one of original_payout_id and reversed_by_payout_id. |
| `statement_descriptor` | Optional | string | Text shown on your bank statement for the deposit, when one was set. |
| `status` | Required | string | Where the payout is: pending until it is sent, in_transit on its way to your bank, then paid or failed. A paid payout can still become failed if the bank returns the deposit, and canceled means a manual payout was canceled while pending. Values: `"pending"`, `"in_transit"`, `"paid"`, `"failed"`, `"canceled"`. |
| `trace_id` | Optional | [PayoutTraceID](../models/PayoutTraceID.md#payouttraceid) | The bank's trace number for the deposit, which your bank can use to locate a late deposit. Its status says whether the number is pending, available, or unsupported, and value holds the number when Flint has it. Absent when Flint has no trace information. A payout's bank trace ID, with whether it is pending, available, or unsupported. |
| `updated_at` | Required | string | When the payout last changed. Format: `date-time`. |
