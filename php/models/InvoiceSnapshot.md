A frozen copy of an issued invoice's content, including line items, charges, discounts, tax identities, and pricing amounts.

Response model.

| Field | Presence | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `billing_address` | Optional | [Address](../models/Address.md#address) | Billing address captured on the invoice. Kept after the customer is deleted, because an issued invoice must keep it. A postal address, as returned on customers, invoices, tax locations, and fulfillment recipients. `billing_address`: [field definitions](../models/InvoiceSnapshot.md#invoicesnapshotbilling_address). |
| `buyer_note` | Optional | string | The backing order's buyer note, captured on the invoice. |
| `buyer_tax_identity` | Required | [TaxIdentity](../models/TaxIdentity.md#taxidentity) or null | Buyer tax identity captured on the invoice. Kept after the customer is deleted, because an issued invoice must keep it. |
| `charges` | Optional | Array of [OrderCharge](../models/OrderCharge.md#ordercharge) | The backing order's service charges, frozen at issue. |
| `customer_display_name` | Optional | string | Buyer name captured on the invoice. Kept after the customer is deleted, because an issued invoice must keep it. |
| `customer_email` | Optional | string | Buyer email captured on the invoice. |
| `discounts` | Optional | Array of [InvoiceDiscount](../models/InvoiceDiscount.md#invoicediscount) | The discounts applied to the backing order, frozen at issue. |
| `internal_note` | Optional | string | The backing order's internal note, captured on the invoice. Merchant reads only; buyer reads leave it out. |
| `line_items` | Optional | Array of [InvoiceLineItem](../models/InvoiceLineItem.md#invoicelineitem) | The billed line items, frozen at issue. A draft previews the backing order's lines. |
| `merchant_display_name` | Optional | string | Your business name as shown on the invoice. A draft shows your current name; issue freezes it. |
| `pricing_amounts` | Required | [PricingAmounts](../models/PricingAmounts.md#pricingamounts) | The invoice's pricing totals. Its total_money is the invoice total that the top-level total_money reports. The money totals for an order or invoice: subtotal, discounts, charges, tax, requested tip, and total. |
| `requested_tip` | Optional | [InvoiceTip](../models/InvoiceTip.md#invoicetip) | The tip requested on the backing order, frozen at issue. Absent when none was requested. A tip requested on an invoice, set as a fixed amount or a percentage, with an optional name and description. |
| `seller_tax_identity` | Required | [TaxIdentity](../models/TaxIdentity.md#taxidentity) or null | Identity frozen on the source invoice at issue. Later profile edits do not change this document. |
| `tax_breakdowns` | Required | Array of (object and Alternative shapes (see declared variants)) | Tax jurisdiction rows for this invoice. A draft previews the backing order's current rows; issue freezes them, and the API, hosted invoice, and PDF share the frozen rows. External tax produces these rows. Automatic tax doesn't, so an automatic-tax invoice reports its tax in pricing_amounts and each line's tax_money. On a newly issued external-tax invoice, rows sum to pricing_amounts.tax_money, and rows with price_mode inclusive sum to pricing_amounts.inclusive_tax_money. A row's order_line_item_id matches the same field on InvoiceLineItem; order_charge_id names a charge in charges. Always [] when no tax rows apply. Some older external-tax invoices have no frozen rows. `tax_breakdowns[]`: [declared alternatives](../models/OrderTax.md#ordertaxtax_breakdowns). |
