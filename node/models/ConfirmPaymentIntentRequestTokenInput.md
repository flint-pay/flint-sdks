## ConfirmPaymentIntentRequestTokenInput

Request input. Response: [ConfirmPaymentIntentRequestToken](../models/ConfirmPaymentIntentRequestToken.md#confirmpaymentintentrequesttoken).

The `token` variant of `ConfirmPaymentIntentRequest`.





| Field | Presence | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `buyer_ip_address` | Optional | string | The buyer's IP address, for risk screening, when your server pays on the buyer's behalf. Write-only. minLength: `1`. maxLength: `64`. Input only. |
| `client_action_type` | Optional | string | How to complete the authentication step. Flint's API returns a Stripe client secret only for client_action_type stripe. A url action opens in a redirect, popup, or iframe; Stripe's authentication page receives what it needs to run the challenge, including the client secret for hosted 3DS2. If a payment is confirmed with a payment method Flint didn't approve, Flint doesn't count the charge, returns it to the buyer, and the payment intent ends canceled with cancellation_reason payment_returned. The Stripe secret can also confirm the payment with another card, so use it only with handleNextAction. Reader credentials do not support url; omit client_action_type or send stripe for reader payments. Defaults to stripe for a new confirmation; omission on a continuation keeps the existing type. Default: `"stripe"`. Values: `"url"`, `"stripe"`. |
| `credential_type` | Required | string | Values: `"token"`. |
| `expected_version` | Optional | integer | Optional expected version of this resource. A stale value returns 409 VERSION_CONFLICT with the current version. Retrieve the resource and rebuild the request before retrying. Format: `uint64`. minimum: `1`. |
| `payment_return_url` | Optional | string | Where Flint sends the buyer after a redirect or authentication step, adding only payment_intent_id for a payment, or payment_method_id for a setup. The completion message uses type flint.payment_action.completed and exactly that one subject key. Without it, the step ends on a Flint page that tells the parent or opener the step completed. Accepts an absolute HTTPS URL or an app return URL with a custom scheme other than http, javascript, data, file, blob, or about. Cannot contain credentials, a query, or a fragment. Test mode also accepts HTTP loopback URLs. With a checkout credential on order pay, omit payment_return_url; checkout sessions use their own configured return URL. minLength: `1`. maxLength: `2048`. |
| `payment_source_token` | Required | string | Opaque processor or browser payment source token. minLength: `1`. |
| `save_payment_method` | Optional | boolean | On /confirm, saves cards only for standalone payment intents. Saves the card this confirmation collects for the payment intent's customer, with usage off_session, so you can charge it later without the buyer: subscriptions, automatic invoices, or the customer's default. Send true only when the buyer agreed to that on your page. Requires customer_id on the payment intent, a card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay credential in stripe.confirmation_token (created with setup_future_usage off_session) or payment_source_token, and payments.payment_methods.write. Flint saves the card once the payment is approved, sends payment_method.activated, and sets payment_source.card.payment_method_id. If the bank asks the buyer to authenticate, current_payment_action carries it; that one authentication also covers the saved card. For order-owned payment intents, POST /v1/orders/{order_id}/pay saves only on_session cards using the checkout session's own credential. Default: `false`. |
