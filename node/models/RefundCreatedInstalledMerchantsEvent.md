| `status` | Required | string | Summary of payment_refunds and tender_allocations.

Follow refund.created when it is accepted, refund.succeeded, refund.partially_succeeded, or refund.failed when its outcome changes, and refund.updated for other changes. Values: `"pending"`, `"succeeded"`, `"partially_succeeded"`, `"failed"`. |
| `succeeded_at` | Optional | string | When `status` first became `succeeded`. For a refund with `payment_refunds` or `tender_allocations`, it's when the last of them first succeeded, so it equals the latest `succeeded_at` among them. For a refund Flint processes, it's when Flint recorded the outcome; with `processed_by` `merchant`, it equals `refunded_at`. Present only while `status` is `succeeded`; absent for every other status, including `partially_succeeded` and a refund that failed after it succeeded. A refund that succeeds again shows its first success time. Format: `date-time`. Example: `"2026-08-02T16:00:00Z"`. |
| `tax_breakdown_refunds` | Optional | Array of [RefundTaxBreakdownRefund](../models/RefundTaxBreakdownRefund.md#refundtaxbreakdownrefund) | Tax reversed on order-level charges and flat taxes, one entry per tax breakdown. Tax reversed on line items is in `line_item_allocations[].tax_breakdown_refunds`. |

Return it through a new refund against payment_intent_id and order_line_item_id. It does not issue another card. Source remaining and pending amounts describe the entire original settlement allocation; repeated entries for that source are not additive. |
| `updated_at` | Required | string | RFC3339 timestamp. Format: `date-time`. Example: `"2026-08-02T16:00:00Z"`. |
| `version` | Required | integer | Persisted version of this resource's owned state. Expanded resources and external observations can change independently. Format: `uint64`. minimum: `1`. |
