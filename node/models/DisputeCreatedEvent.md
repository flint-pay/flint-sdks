### DisputeCreatedEvent.data

| Field | Presence | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `object` | Required | object and [Dispute](../models/Dispute.md#dispute) | A challenge to a collected payment. `object`: [field definitions](../models/DisputeCreatedEvent.md#disputecreatedeventdataobject). |

### DisputeCreatedEvent.data.object

A challenge to a collected payment.

| Field | Presence | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `amount_money` | Required | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | Amount in dispute. For a chargeback, this amount left your balance when the case opened; an inquiry moves no money. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. `amount_money`: [field definitions](../models/Dispute.md#disputeamount_money). |
| `can_respond_with_evidence` | Required | boolean | Whether this dispute has an evidence response window. It stays true after the window closes or a decision is made. Use is_action_required to know whether a response is needed now. |
| `case_type` | Required | string | Values: `"inquiry"`, `"chargeback"`, `"compliance"`, `"resolution"`, `"block"`, `"other"`, `"bank_return"`. |
| `created_at` | Required | string | RFC3339 timestamp. Format: `date-time`. |
| `customer` | Optional | [ExpandedCustomerSummary](../models/ExpandedCustomerSummary.md#expandedcustomersummary) or null | Present only when `expand` includes `customer`; `null` when expanded and there is no related customer. |
| `customer_id` | Optional | string | The customer on the disputed payment. Absent when the payment has none. |
| `dispute_id` | Required | string | Stable identifier of the dispute. |
| `evidence_due_at` | Required | string or null | Deadline for submitting evidence. Respond before it when is_action_required is true. `null` when the dispute has no response window, such as a bank return or a case your processor gave no deadline for. Format: `date-time`. |
| `evidence_submission_count` | Required | integer | How many times evidence was submitted for this dispute. 0 until you submit. Format: `int32`. |
| `fraud_warning_id` | Optional | string | The fraud warning the card network sent for this payment before the dispute. Absent when there was none. |
| `has_evidence` | Required | boolean | Whether evidence is saved for this dispute, submitted or not. evidence_submission_count says whether it was submitted. |
| `is_action_required` | Required | boolean | Whether you need to respond now: true while status is needs_response or inquiry_needs_response, can_respond_with_evidence is true, and evidence_due_at hasn't passed. Flint evaluates it each time you read the dispute, so it turns false when the deadline passes without a webhook. |
| `is_evidence_deadline_passed` | Required | boolean | Whether evidence_due_at has passed on a dispute with a response window. Flint evaluates it each time you read the dispute. Always false when can_respond_with_evidence is false. |
| `merchant_id` | Required | string |  |
| `order` | Optional | [ExpandedOrderSummary](../models/ExpandedOrderSummary.md#expandedordersummary) or null | Present only when `expand` includes `order`; `null` when expanded and there is no related order. |
| `order_id` | Optional | string |  |
| `payment_intent` | Optional | [ExpandedPaymentIntentSummary](../models/ExpandedPaymentIntentSummary.md#expandedpaymentintentsummary) or null | Present only when `expand` includes `payment_intent`; `null` when expanded and there is no related payment intent. |
| `payment_intent_id` | Optional | string |  |
| `payment_option` | Required | string or null | Values: `"card"`, `"apple_pay"`, `"google_pay"`, `"affirm"`, `"ach_debit"`, `null`. |
| `reason` | Required | string | Values: [12 declared values](Dispute.md#dispute-reason-values). |
| `response_unavailable_reason` | Optional | string | Why a response is unavailable when can_respond_with_evidence is false. Absent when no reason is reported. Current values are bank_return_not_contestable and response_window_unavailable. response_window_unavailable means no evidence deadline was supplied. Values: `"bank_return_not_contestable"`, `"response_window_unavailable"`. |
| `status` | Required | string | Values: `"inquiry_needs_response"`, `"inquiry_under_review"`, `"inquiry_closed"`, `"needs_response"`, `"under_review"`, `"won"`, `"lost"`, `"prevented"`, `"other"`. |
| `status_changed_at` | Optional | string | Recorded time of the current status. On first observation this is the dispute creation time. Later status changes use the provider event time when available, or the time Flint observed the change. This may not be the exact decision or submission time. Format: `date-time`. |
| `updated_at` | Required | string | RFC3339 timestamp. Format: `date-time`. |
