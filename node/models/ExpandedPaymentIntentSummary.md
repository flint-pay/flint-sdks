## ExpandedPaymentIntentSummary

A payment intent's summary fields, including amount, status, and capture method, returned when the payment intent is expanded.





| Field | Presence | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `amount_money` | Required | [MoneyValue](../models/MoneyValue.md#moneyvalue) | The amount requested from the buyer, including any tip_money. Capturing doesn't change it: after a partial capture it still shows the requested amount, and captured_money shows what was collected. On a standalone payment intent, PATCH can change it only before the first confirmation attempt. Monetary amount represented as integer minor units plus an ISO 4217 currency code. `amount_money`: [field definitions](../models/BuyerPaymentAttemptPaymentIntent.md#buyerpaymentattemptpaymentintentamount_money). |
| `capture_method` | Optional | string | When money is collected. Defaults to automatic. Values: `"automatic"`, `"manual"`. |
| `created_at` | Optional | string | RFC3339 timestamp. Format: `date-time`. |
| `customer_id` | Optional | string | Customer linked to this payment intent. |
| `order_id` | Optional | string | Order this payment intent belongs to. Create it through the order and confirm it with POST /v1/orders/{order_id}/pay. Capture and cancel use POST /v1/payment-intents/{payment_intent_id}/capture or /cancel for every payment intent. Order-owned intents accept PATCH for metadata and external_reference_id. |
| `payment_intent_id` | Required | string | Flint payment intent ID. |
| `payment_source` | Optional | [PaymentSourceSummary](../models/PaymentSourceSummary.md#paymentsourcesummary) | Summary of the card or bank account used for the payment. Absent until a payment source is attached. A summary of the payment source used for a payment, by funding-method family, with card or bank account display details. |
| `refund_status` | Optional | string | How much of captured_money has been refunded, including value issued as store credit, based on refunded_money. Values: `"none"`, `"partially_refunded"`, `"refunded"`. |
| `status` | Required | string | Lifecycle status. requires_payment_method covers both a new payment intent and one whose last attempt failed, so read last_payment_error with it. succeeded, canceled, and expired are final. Refunds and disputes never change status. Values: `"requires_payment_method"`, `"requires_confirmation"`, `"requires_action"`, `"processing"`, `"requires_capture"`, `"canceled"`, `"succeeded"`, `"expired"`. |
| `updated_at` | Optional | string | RFC3339 timestamp. Format: `date-time`. |
| `version` | Required | integer string | Persisted version of this resource's owned state. Expanded resources and external observations can change independently. Use an integer string (decimal digits), not a floating-point number. Format: `uint64`. minimum: `1`. |
