# Repository guidance

This is a public repository. Never add, commit, or expose secrets, credentials,
tokens, API keys, private keys, passwords, or other sensitive configuration.
Use clearly fake placeholder values in examples and tests.

The Node.js/TypeScript and PHP SDKs are generated from Flint's pinned OpenAPI
contract. Do not hand-edit generated package files. Make SDK changes in
[`flint-pay/sdk-generator`](https://github.com/flint-pay/sdk-generator) and
regenerate this repository as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Before submitting changes, run the narrowest relevant validation command. For
generated SDK updates, use the repository's generation and validation workflow
documented in [README.md](README.md).

## Deferred findings in Linear

Finish the user's task. A Linear ticket records independent future work; it never
substitutes for required implementation, investigation, root-cause fixes, or validation.

- Keep work needed for the requested outcome, acceptance criteria, or relevant checks in
  the current task. Fix regressions introduced by your changes. Difficulty, size, elapsed
  time, failing tests, or an unfamiliar subsystem are not reasons to offload required work.
- Before deferring, establish that the requested outcome will be correct, complete, and
  verified without addressing the finding, and explain why it is independently out of scope.
  If it is required or blocking, continue working under the existing authorization boundaries.
  If access or approval actually blocks you, report the blocker and unfinished work plainly;
  creating a ticket does not resolve the blocker or make the task complete.
- Automatically capture substantial, actionable bugs, reliability or performance problems,
  and maintenance obstacles encountered during authorized work. Require concrete evidence
  and a clear next step. Skip minor unrelated cleanup, stylistic preferences, and speculative
  concerns. Do not expand the task into a general audit to generate tickets.
- Search Linear for the same underlying problem before creating anything. Add materially
  new evidence to an existing issue when appropriate; do not repeat comments, reopen issues,
  or change their ownership, scheduling, priority, or review labels just because they recur.
- A create error or timeout does not prove that creation failed. Before retrying, search for
  the same problem and source task, inspect matches, and reuse a confirmed existing issue.
  If the result remains ambiguous or search is unavailable, report the unconfirmed creation
  instead of blindly retrying or claiming that a ticket was saved.
- Create new findings in the **Flint Pay** team (`FLI`, team ID
  `3a7d17d9-34c8-42c4-b298-02f82f5e508c`), status **Backlog**, with both
  **agent-discovered** and **needs-triage**. Leave assignee, delegate, cycle, due date,
  priority, and estimate unset. Link an existing project only when the association is clear.
  Filing does not authorize scheduling, delegation, or implementation of the deferred work.
- Use a specific problem title. Include the observed behavior, expected behavior, evidence
  or reproduction, likely impact, repository and code references, source task or PR when
  available, the explicit reason for deferral, and acceptance criteria or an investigation
  next step. Distinguish confirmed facts from hypotheses; never include secrets or private
  customer data. Prefer commit permalinks for code references when available.
- Continue the original task and report created or updated ticket links in the final response,
  separately from completed work and genuine blockers. If Linear or duplicate search is
  unavailable, finish the authorized work and report the unfiled finding without claiming
  that a ticket exists. Routine eligible findings do not require per-ticket confirmation.
- The shared **Agent findings** view is the review queue: unresolved issues with both labels.
  **Agent backlog** shows all unresolved **agent-discovered** issues, including reviewed ones.
  After an authorized review decision, remove **needs-triage** and retain **agent-discovered**.
  Do not mark findings reviewed merely because they were filed or automatically summarized.
- Use authenticated Linear tools in the current agent environment. When first using Linear
  in a session, verify access to the Flint Pay team. Repository guidance does not install
  tools or authenticate another client or machine; use that environment's normal MCP setup
  and login flow. Never put credentials in repository files or copy tokens between machines.
- Agents may search, summarize, and group tickets freely. Apply explicitly requested bulk
  metadata changes and report the affected issues. Resolve ambiguous target sets before
  mutation; closing, assigning, scheduling, or starting work requires the requested action
  or an applicable standing instruction.
